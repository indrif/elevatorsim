Why a simulator for elevators?
---
Valid question! At the place I work we have elevators, as with many workplaces. However from time to time they seem to make stupid decisions that causes frustration for people waiting. This has caused a discussion to arise regarding how hard it could be to write a decent elevator software. After many weeks of thinking about this issue I decided to put together a basic simulator to be able to try this out.
